                        The owner and programmer of The Anime Grid! I've been a huge anime and manga fan ever since my friend introduced me in high school, and I'm excited to share my passion with all of you.
                        <br><br>
                        As a programmer, I built this website from scratch with the goal of creating a space where anime and manga fans can come together to explore and discuss their favorite shows and series. I'm always looking for ways to improve the site and make it more user-friendly, so please don't hesitate to reach out with feedback or suggestions.
                        <br><br>
                        When I'm not working on the website, you can usually find me watching the latest anime releases or reading manga. Some of my favorite stories are Cowboy Bebop, Berserk, Tokyo Ghoul, and Vinland Saga.
                        <br><br>
                        And of course, I can't forget about my love for Funko Pops! I currently have over 250 funkos in my collection, and I'm always on the lookout for new ones to add to my shelves. Some of my favorites include my Signed NYCC Brook, Spike Spiegal, First ever signed Makima Funko Pop (Custom made by me), and Japan Expo Gyomei Chase.

                        I am one of the writers for The Anime Grid since the beginning doing my best to make it the best blog to come to for all things anime, manga, and games. I am an avid fan of anime and love exploring new series in my free time.
                        <br><br>
                        When not watching anime or writing blog posts, I enjoys watching sports, particularly basketball, football, and Wrestling. I'm also passionate about creating my own content, from my developing YouTube channel to producing music. I often incorporate my love of anime into my personal projects, and my unique perspective and creativity makes my work truly stand out.
                        <br><br>
                        My fresh perspective to The Anime Grid with my writing and enthusiasm for the genre. I always try and make my posts well-researched and thoughtfully written, and am constantly exploring new angles and ideas to keep my content engaging and informative.

                        I am a quiz master, theory crafter, and tier list ranker. I'm a passionate fan of anime, manga, and video games. My main focus is making engaging content and writing fun and engaging quizzes that challenge your knowledge of anime, as well as theories that keep you on the edge of your seat.
                        <br><br>
                        When not creating new quizzes or crafting fan theories, I love to dive deep into my favorite anime series like Attack on Titan and One Piece. My enthusiasm for video games is also legendary, and am always up playing the newest multiplayer games with friends.
                        <br><br>
                        One of my greatest strengths is my sense of humor. My natural gift for injecting humor into my writing and making my readers laugh out loud. My reviews are always insightful and entertaining, with a unique perspective that keeps readers engaged from start to finish.
                        <br><br>
                        My passion for anime, manga, and video games I like to think shines through my posts and I hope all my readers think so as well!
